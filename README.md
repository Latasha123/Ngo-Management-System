<h1>NGO Management System</h1>

NGO Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform built with Java Spring Boot to help non-governmental organizations (NGOs) streamline their operations and enhance transparency.

The system manages donors, volunteers, events, and fundraising campaigns efficiently, while providing automated email notifications for critical actions such as registrations, event updates, and donation acknowledgements.

Itâ€™s designed for scalability and modularity, integrating seamlessly with relational databases and offering a secure, role-based access structure.
